# Monte-Carlo-Techniques
Monte Carlo Techniques applied to the TMON subject from the Master's Degree in Statistical &amp; Computational Information Processing (Data Science) at Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

## Structure:
### 1. DTMC simulation process
You can find a DTMC (Discrete-Time Markov Chain) in this folder for an old car simulation process example. This script can be applied to any basic DTMC.
### 2. MM1
Queueing model denoted for the Kendall Notation as M/M/1. This model is applied to a car wash example model but can be extrapolated to any M/M/1 queue.
### 3. CI
Confidence Intervals and hypothesis tests over the assumption of sample randomness and independence.
### 4. Pseudo-random number generation
Generation methods:
 - Von Neumann generation method.
 - Lehmer generation method.
 - Linear congruential mixed and complete generation methods.
Independence tests:
 - Wald Wolfowitz's Runs Test for randomness contrast.
 - KS (Kolgomorov-Smirnov) Independency test and Chi-Squared test for goodness of fit to a uniform distribution test.
### 5. Random variables generation
 - Hit-and-miss method for pseudorandom continuos-variable generation.
 - Inverse Transform Method for pseudorandom variable generation.
 - Rejection, Rejection sampling and Rejection Generalized methods for any non-canonical probability distribution generation.
 - Composition method for pseudorandom mixed-variables generation.
 - Discrete, mixed and continuous random variables generation.
 - Limit central theorem.
